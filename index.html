                "A couple years ago I started to get into technology.  I have always been into video games but I wanted to dive into the world of PCs.  I had made some new friends that were all pc gamers and I wanted to learn more about it.  So I started to do some research and buying all the parts I needed to build a really nice computer that would last me a couple years.  I was so nervous when building the computer because I read all about horror stories where people paid thousands of dollars on parts and simple mistakes ruined the computer.  I just had to make sure I was well equiped with the knowledge I needed and dive right in.  Now two years later I use my computer almost every day."
